            Meanwhile, prepare these chops with a tomato based sauce 
            and serve them with hot cooked pasta and fresh sliced mushrooms.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pork chops</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks chopped celery, with leaves</li>
            <li>12 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season pork chops with garlic salt to taste. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. 
                Add chops and brown in oil for about 4 to 6 minutes each side. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, saute onion and celery until translucent. Add tomato paste and heat through, stirring, 
                until liquid is bubbling. Add tomato sauce and heat through, stirring, until bubbling. 
                Add water to thin sauce. Return chops to skillet, reduce heat to very low and let simmer until meat 
                is very tender and sauce thickens (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours), adding water as needed.</li>
        </ol>
